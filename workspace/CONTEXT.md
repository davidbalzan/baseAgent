## Token Usage
- Average 39,899 prompt tokens per session (567 output tokens)
- Total cost across 20 sessions: $0.0500
- 7 sessions used >20K prompt tokens

## Recommendations
- Break down complex tasks into smaller steps
- Consider creating conditional tool groups for common task categories
- High-token sessions may benefit from reduced tool prompts

## Application
When planning sessions, proactively suggest tool grouping for complex tasks to reduce token usage.
