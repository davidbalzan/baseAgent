Hey David! Great to see you back. Let me bring you up to speed on where the baseAgent project stands.

### Current Status

**Project Health**: ✅ Excellent  
**Test Suite**: 307 tests passing across 31 test files  
**Architecture**: Fully implemented with plugins, multi-channel gateway, and trace dashboard  

### Recent Progress (Latest Commits)

- **Latest (f52a6fb)**: Telegram plugin fixes, tool-failure recovery, plugin management tools, and Anthropic OAuth support
- **Recent work**: Agent self-improvement tools, plugin system enhancements, dashboard chat plugin, docs plugin
- **Architecture**: Plugin system with scheduler, colored logs, hallucination detection, dual-model routing

### Current Architecture

The project is now a **comprehensive agentic application framework** with:

- **Self-contained plugin architecture** (ADR-009) - plugins manage their own lifecycle 
- **Plugin dashboard extension system** (ADR-008) - plugins contribute their own UI tabs
- **Multi-channel gateway** - Telegram, Discord, Slack adapters with streaming support
- **Streaming ReAct loop** with resumable sessions persisted to SQLite
- **Governance system** with configurable policies (auto-allow/confirm/deny) per tool
- **Built-in tools** including self-improvement capabilities, MCP server integration, web search
- **Trace replay dashboard** with live streaming and deep-link support

### Key Architectural Decisions

Recent ADRs show solid technical foundations:
- **ADR-007**: Zod schemas as single source of truth for all validation 
- **ADR-005**: Vercel AI SDK v6 for multi-provider LLM abstraction
- **ADR-003**: SQLite for all persistence (zero external dependencies)

### Project Structure

The monorepo architecture is well-established:
- **11 packages** including core, gateway, memory, tools, server, and 6 plugins
- **Skills system** for hot-reloadable custom tools
- **Workspace memory** with Markdown files (SOUL.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md, etc.)
- **Full documentation** with PRD, decisions, capabilities reference

### What's Next

The foundation is **rock solid** - comprehensive testing, clean architecture, full functionality. You're at a great point to:

1. **Add domain-specific skills** for your use cases
2. **Extend the plugin system** with new channel adapters or background services  
3. **Enhance the dashboard** with additional monitoring/management features
4. **Build custom integrations** in `packages/app/src/index.ts`

The project has evolved into exactly what the PRD envisioned - a general-purpose agentic application template ready for specialization. What would you like to work on today?
