**text:** Hey! 💧

**Time for a water break!**

It's 2:08 PM on a Friday afternoon — perfect moment to pause, grab a glass of water, and hydrate. Your brain (and body) will thank you.

Quick tip: If you've been heads-down in work, this is also a good excuse to stretch your legs while you're up.

Stay hydrated, stay awesome. 🥤

**reasoningText:** The user has a scheduled task to remind them to drink water. This is a simple reminder task. I should provide a friendly, helpful reminder about staying hydrated. Let me check if there's any relevant context in the user's memory files first, then deliver the reminder.

Actually, for a simple reminder like this, I don't need to read files - I can just deliver the reminder directly. The task is straightforward: remind the user to drink water.

Let me provide a friendly, personable reminder that matches the personality guidelines - witty, pleasant, supportive.
