## Trace Events

### `session_start` — iter 0

**input:** try again

*2026-02-21T07:41:21.277Z*

### `reason` — iter 1

*17821 in / 259 out tokens*

**text:** I'm not sure what you'd like me to try again. Could you clarify what you'd like me to do? For example:

- Would you like me to check the weather again?
- Would you like me to confirm today's date?
- Is there something else you'd like me to attempt?

Let me know what you need!
**toolCallCount:** 0
**reasoningText:** The user is asking me to "try again" but I'm not sure what they want me to try again. Looking at the conversation history, the last few messages were:

1. User: "what's the weather today?" - I provided the weather
2. User: "what's today's date?" - I provided the date (Saturday, February 21, 2026)
3. User: "--- Above is conversation history for context. Only respond to the current message below. ---" - I acknowledged this
4. User: "try again" - I'm not sure what to try again

The user might be referring to:
- The weather forecast (maybe they want it updated?)
- The date (maybe they want it confirmed?)
- Something else entirely

Since I don't have context for what they want me to try again, I should ask for clarification. I should be direct and concise as per my personality guidelines.

### `narration_nudge` — iter 1

**narrationText:** I'm not sure what you'd like me to try again. Could you clarify what you'd like me to do? For example:

- Would you like me to check the weather again?
- Would you like me to confirm today's date?
- Is there something else you'd like me to attempt?

Let me know what you need!

### `reason` — iter 2

*17911 in / 142 out tokens*

**text:** Understood. What would you like me to do?
**toolCallCount:** 0
**reasoningText:** The user is giving me a clear instruction: "Do not describe what you plan to do — call the tools now and return the final result."

This is a directive to take action directly without explaining my plan first. I should use tools to accomplish whatever task the user is asking for.

However, the user hasn't actually asked me to do anything specific in this message. They just said "try again" in the previous message, and I asked for clarification. Now they're giving me a general instruction about how to respond.

I should acknowledge this instruction and ask what they'd like me to do, or if they want me to try something specific.
