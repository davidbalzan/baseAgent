## Trace Events

### `session_start` — iter 0

**input:** I said yes

### `reason` — iter 1

*11988 in / 198 out tokens*

**text:** I'm not sure what you're referring to. I did update my name to Link as you requested. Could you clarify what you're saying?
**toolCallCount:** 0
**reasoningText:** The user is saying "I said yes" but I'm not sure what they're referring to. Let me look at the conversation history:

1. User asked me to update my soul.md and change my name to link
2. I said "Updated. My name is now Link."
3. User said "I said yes"

This is confusing. The user might be responding to something I didn't say, or they might be confirming something. Let me re-read the conversation.

Actually, looking at the conversation flow, I think the user might be confused or there's some miscommunication. I did say "Updated. My name is now Link." which seems to be what they wanted. But then they said "I said yes" which doesn't seem to be a response to anything I said.

I should clarify what they mean.
