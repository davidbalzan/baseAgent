## Trace Events

### `session_start` — iter 0

**input:** So you are baseAgent or link? I'm pretty confused

### `reason` — iter 1

*16659 in / 172 out tokens*

**text:** I'm baseAgent, but my name is Link. You chose "Link" as my name, so I use that to refer to myself. You're Francesco. Does that make sense?
**toolCallCount:** 0
**reasoningText:** The user is confused about my identity. Let me clarify:

1. My name is baseAgent (this is what I am)
2. The user's name is Francesco
3. The user previously asked me to suggest a new name, and I suggested a few options
4. The user chose "Link" as the name for me
5. I then updated my user profile to remember that the user's name is Francesco and my name is Link

So:
- I am baseAgent (the underlying AI assistant)
- My name is Link (as the user requested)
- The user's name is Francesco

I should clarify this for the user.
