### `reason` — iter 1

*10777 in / 293 out tokens*

**text:** Hey! 👋 Time for your stretch break!

You've probably been sitting for a while — here's your friendly nudge to:

1. **Stand up** and shake out your limbs
2. **Roll your shoulders** back a few times
3. **Stretch your neck** — gentle side-to-side and ear-to-shoulder
4. **Reach for the ceiling** and take a deep breath
5. **Do a quick back twist** if you're able

Even just 2-3 minutes of movement helps with circulation, focus, and preventing stiffness. Your future self will thank you! 💪

**reasoningText:** The user has a scheduled task to remind them to stretch. This is a simple reminder task. I should provide a friendly, helpful reminder about stretching. Let me check if there's any relevant context in the user's memory files first, but given the simplicity of this task, I can just deliver the reminder directly.

Actually, since this is a straightforward reminder task, I should just deliver it directly without overcomplicating things. The task is to remind the user to stretch - I'll do that in a friendly, supportive way that matches the personality guidelines.
