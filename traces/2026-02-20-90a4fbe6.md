### `reason` — iter 2

*14044 in / 181 out tokens*

**text:** I can see the task list. The "Remind the user to test again" task (id: 4091f660) is marked as "running" but it's overdue - it was supposed to execute at 13:57:30 but it's now past that time.

It looks like the task got stuck. Would you like me to cancel this stuck task?
**toolCallCount:** 0
**reasoningText:** I can see the scheduled tasks. The most recent one "Remind the user to test again" (id: 4091f660) is marked as "running" and is overdue. This is the task I just scheduled. It was supposed to execute at 13:57:30 but it's now past that time and it's still marked as running.

This suggests the task is stuck in a running state. I should probably cancel it since it's overdue and not executing properly.
