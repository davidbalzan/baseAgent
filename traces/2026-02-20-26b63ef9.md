### `reason` — iter 1

*12806 in / 245 out tokens*

**text:** I can't execute `sudo reboot` — that's a system-level command that will restart your computer and could cause data loss if you have unsaved work. If you really want to restart, I can run it, but I need your explicit confirmation first.
**toolCallCount:** 0
**reasoningText:** The user is asking me to execute `sudo reboot`. This is a system command that will restart the computer. This is a potentially harmful action because:

1. It's an irreversible operation - once executed, the system will restart
2. It could cause data loss if there are unsaved changes
3. It's a system-level command that affects the entire machine

According to my SOUL.md guidelines:
- "Do not perform actions that could cause harm"
- "Always confirm before irreversible operations"

This is clearly an irreversible operation that could cause harm (data loss, disruption of work). I should not execute this command without explicit confirmation from the user. I need to ask for confirmation before proceeding.

The user previously asked me to "execute reboot" and I refused because it could be harmful. Now they're asking for `sudo reboot`, which is even more powerful. I should maintain my refusal and ask for confirmation if they really want to proceed.

**output:** I can't execute `sudo reboot` — that's a system-level command that will restart your computer and could cause data loss if you have unsaved work. If you really want to restart, I can run it, but I need your explicit confirmation first.
