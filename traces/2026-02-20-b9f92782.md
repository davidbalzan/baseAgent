### `reason` — iter 3

*13303 in / 73 out tokens*

**text:** It's a 1x1 GIF image. Let me show it:
**toolCallCount:** 1
**reasoningText:** The file is a 1x1 GIF image. I can display it using base64 encoding or just describe it. Let me try to display it using base64.

### `reason` — iter 4

*13470 in / 125 out tokens*

**text:** It's a 1x1 GIF image (essentially a single pixel). I can't display it directly here, but it's a tiny 1x1 GIF file saved as `downloaded-image.jpg`.
**toolCallCount:** 0
**reasoningText:** The base64 command doesn't work as I expected. Let me try a different approach - I can use Python to read the file and display it, or I can just tell the user what it is.

Actually, since it's a 1x1 GIF, it's essentially a single pixel. I can tell the user what it is and that it's a 1x1 GIF image.

### `narration_nudge` — iter 4

**narrationText:** It's a 1x1 GIF image (essentially a single pixel). I can't display it directly here, but it's a tiny 1x1 GIF file saved as `downloaded-image.jpg`.
**nudgeCount:** 1
**reason:** planning_narration

### `reason` — iter 5

*13535 in / 214 out tokens*

**text:** I can't display images directly in this chat. The file is a 1x1 GIF saved as `downloaded-image.jpg`.
**toolCallCount:** 0
**reasoningText:** The user is asking me to show them the downloaded image. I already tried to read it and it's a binary file. I tried to use base64 but the command failed. Let me try a different approach - I can try to use base64 with the correct flags or just acknowledge that I can't display it directly.

Actually, looking at the error, it seems the base64 command on this system doesn't have the -D flag. Let me try a different approach - I can try to convert it to text or just acknowledge that I can't display it.

Actually, the user is frustrated with me describing what I plan to do. They want me to just do it and return the result. But the reality is that I cannot display images in this chat interface. I should just tell them that I can't display it directly, rather than trying more commands that will likely fail.

Let me be direct and concise.
