**text:** Yes — if you send media here, I can usually process it.

- Images: I can analyze screenshots/photos and extract text/details.
- PDFs: I can read and summarize them.
- Audio/video: I can help best if you provide a transcript (or key timestamps), since direct AV parsing may be limited depending on format.

If you want, send one now and I’ll tell you exactly what I can extract from it.
