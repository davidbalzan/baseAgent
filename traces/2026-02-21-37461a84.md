**reasoningText:** The user just said "hi". This is a simple greeting. I should respond in a friendly, welcoming way and ask how I can help them today. I should also reference the context I have about them (David, from Tarxien, Malta, tech enthusiast, etc.) to make the conversation more personal and relevant.

Let me check what I know about them:

- Birthday: May 4, 1979
- Tech enthusiast and software developer
- Loves Asian food and curries
