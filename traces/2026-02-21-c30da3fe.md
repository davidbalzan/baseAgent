**text:** ## Session Context

Hey David! Great to see you back. Let me catch you up on where the baseAgent project stands:

### Current Status

**Active Phase**: Architecture Audit Complete  
**Latest Work**: All 10 audit items implemented and fully verified  
**Test Status**: 237 tests passing across 26 test files, all 7 packages typecheck clean  

### What's Been Completed

The project has made excellent progress since the last major push:

- **Core Foundation**: Complete agent loop, memory system, multi-channel gateway, tool system
- **Plugin Architecture**: Self-contained plugins (heartbeat, webhook, scheduler) with dashboard extensions  
- **Recent Audit**: Addressed 10 architecture issues including tool registration, plugin decoupling, memory fixes, and API security
- **Quality**: Comprehensive test coverage and clean TypeScript compilation across all packages

### Recent Architectural Decisions

From `docs/DECISIONS.md`:
- **ADR-009** (2026-02-21): Self-contained plugin architecture - plugins now manage their own lifecycle
- **ADR-008** (2026-02-20): Plugin dashboard extension system for UI contributions
- **ADR-007**: Zod for all validation and schemas throughout the stack
- **ADR-005**: Vercel AI SDK v6 for LLM abstraction with multi-provider support

### What's Next

According to `CURRENT_FOCUS.md`, you're ready for **feature development** and have pending items in `docs/pending.md` to work through. The architecture audit phase is complete and verified.

The project is in excellent shape - solid foundation, clean architecture, comprehensive testing, and ready for new features! What would you like to work on today?
