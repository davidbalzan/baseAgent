### `reason` — iter 1

**text:** I'll set up a recurring reminder for you to drink water every 30 minutes.
**toolCallCount:** 1
**reasoningText:** The user wants me to remind them every half hour to drink water. I can use the `schedule_task` function to set this up. I'll schedule it to execute every 30 minutes.

Let me schedule a task that will remind the user to drink water. I'll use a reasonable interval - every 30 minutes. I should set it to execute at a future time, so I'll use the current time + 30 minutes.

Current time is 09:03, so I'll schedule it for 09:33.
