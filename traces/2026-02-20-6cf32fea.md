**reasoningText:** The user has a scheduled task to remind them to drink water. This is a simple reminder task. I should provide a friendly, helpful reminder about staying hydrated. Let me check if there's any relevant context in the user's memory files first, but this is a straightforward task - I can just deliver the reminder directly.

Actually, since this is a simple reminder task, I don't need to read files - I can just deliver the reminder in a friendly, supportive way as per my personality guidelines.
