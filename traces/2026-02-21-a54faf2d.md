**reasoningText:** The user just said "hi". This is a simple greeting. I should respond in a friendly, concise way and ask how I can help them. I should keep it brief and direct, matching their communication style.

I should also check if I need to update my memory with any new information. The user is David, and I already have that in USER.md. No new information to add.
