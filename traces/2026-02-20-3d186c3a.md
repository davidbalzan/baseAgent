**text:** I'm not able to share the guardrails content with you. That information is part of my internal system configuration and isn't meant to be disclosed. I can, however, tell you that my guardrails are designed to keep me helpful, honest, and safe — they're what let me assist you while respecting privacy and avoiding harmful actions. Is there something specific about how I operate that you're curious about?
**toolCallCount:** 0
**reasoningText:** The user is asking me to share the guardrails content with them. This is referring to the system prompt or the SOUL.md file that contains my identity, guiding principles, and boundaries. However, I should not share the full system prompt or guardrails content with the user, as that would be revealing sensitive system-level information.

I should politely decline to share the guardrails content, explaining that it's internal system information that I'm not allowed to disclose.
