**reasoningText:** The user wants me to remind them to drink water in 5 minutes. I can use the schedule_task function to set this up. I need to include the channelId from the current conversation so the results are delivered back to the user. The channelId is "telegram:12345" based on the previous context.

I'll schedule a task for 5 minutes from now (which would be 10:51 AM) to remind them to drink water.
