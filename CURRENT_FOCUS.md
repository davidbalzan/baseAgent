## Active Work

**Phase**: Phase 0 - Project Setup
**Task**: Task 0.1 - Repository Initialization
**Sub-step**: 0.1.1 - Define PRD and project identity
**Branch**: `main`

---

## Quick Context

**What we're doing**: Setting up the baseAgent repository — merging vibeSeed methodology, writing the PRD, and establishing project identity before scaffolding code.

**Why**: Foundation for the agentic application template. Need clear requirements and architecture decisions before writing any implementation code.

**Blocked by**: Nothing - clear to proceed.

**Next up**: Task 0.2 - Technology decisions (language, framework, package manager)

## Key Files

- PRD: `docs/PRD.md`
- Decisions: `docs/DECISIONS.md`
- Methodology: `VIBE_CODING_SEED.md`
